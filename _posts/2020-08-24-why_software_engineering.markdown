When I first started this project, I was incredibly overwhelmed. It was tricky enough to code for the labs and pass the IDE tests, but now the training wheels were really coming off.  I felt like I was barely beginning to understand class and object interactions, and now pulling data from an outside source was an entirely new challenge. I decided to use an API over scraping because I had been repeatedly warned about the challenges that scraping might cause should anything on the website shift or alter. I watched my cohort lead’s video walkthroughs roughly 10,000 times, and watched as she used a pry in her API request to show exactly what information the API was returning and how to parse and search through that information. Since data structures have never felt intuitive to me, watching these videos really helped, and it started to click a little bit more. 

Then came the fun of creating my CLI. I had to implement the previous lessons on conditionals and properly using while, until, and if statements. As I worked on it, I started figuring out how to think like a computer. I worked on reasoning top down and following my program’s logic as it unfolded. In my project, I wanted to create a CLI that would search my meal API based on both ingredient and category. I had to then create a CLI that had two divergent paths of logic to follow. I initially struggled because in my first version on the CLI, the program was built out with the logic to just allow the user to search by ingredient. I had to solve the problem of how to build it out to search for a new attribute. I finally fixed this by creating multiple methods within my CLI, one to prompt a search within each category and another to generate a list of recipes for that specific category. 

After I managed to build out my CLI, I then had to face smaller challenges, such as making sure I wasn’t duplicating objects. Learning how to use pry really helped me to understand how to solve those problems (as did the patient help of my cohort lead). As I go to submit my project, I am still thinking of the things I want to tweak and change. In the interest of time, and passing my project review, I will submit it soon, but at the same time, I wonder if any project ever truly feels complete. I imagine the temptation to refine and improve never goes away. Even now I’m debating about what new features I could add to my CLI, and how I can make it prettier and more user friendly. Since I do have a passion for design, I am excited to begin learning more about the tools I can use to improve the aesthetics of my programs.
